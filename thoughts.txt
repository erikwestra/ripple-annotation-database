Updating the Annotation Database to support public annotations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Some annotations will be publically searchable, while others are private.

The current API will only let people who are authorized do searches against
annotations.

I think we can change the "/search" API endpoint so that the "auth_token" is
optional.  If no auth_token is supplied, then only public annotations can be
searched against.

I'd also like to add a "public" search interface, where simple queries can be
made against public annotations.

Obviously, I'll also need to add an "is_private" field to the annotation
templates, and support this in the "public_annotations" templates.

I think the name "public_annotations" is confusing -- I should probably rename
the "public" application to "user", and change "public_annotations" to
"user_annotations".

No, the public application should remain as "public", as that's the
public-facing portion of the system.  I should just rename "public_annotations"
to "user_annotions".

I should then add a "public search" feature to the public web interface.

Okay, so the specific changes I want to make are:

 * Rename the "public_annotations" template to "user_annotations".

 * Add an "is_public" field to the annotation template.

 * Change the annotation template UI in the admin interface to support
   importing and displaying the "is_public" field.

 * Change the "/search" endpoint to allow the user to search against public
   annotations without having to supply an authentication token.

 * Add a "search" page to the public UI which lets the user search against
   public annotations (only).

 * Update the "specs.md" file to describe the updated API.

 * Update the "Annotation Database Docs" word document (and export to PDF) to
   describe the latest changes.

[Note that I also need to add support for Stellar addresses].
