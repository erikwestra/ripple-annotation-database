Thoughts on the Ripple Annotation Database
------------------------------------------

 * Have a "public" app that implements the public side of the Annotation
   Database.  This is where suitably authorised users can self-annotate their
   accounts.

 * The "/" URL should redirect to "/public".  To access the admin site, the
   user will have to enter the "/admin" URL, or click on the "admin" link from
   the main "/public" page.

 * The main page should handle both new and existing users:

        Welcome to the Ripple Annotation Database

        If you are a new user, please enter the access password you have been
        given:

            Password: [___________________]

                  <Sign Up>

        For existing users, please enter your username and password to sign in:

            Username: [__________________]

            Password: [__________________]

                  <Sign In>

                                                            <Admin Interface>

 * Now, the "/public/home" page.  What should this look like?

    I guess just a menu of options:

        Add Ripple Account    (/public/accounts/add)
        View Ripple Accounts  (/public/accounts/list)
        Change Password       (/public/password)
        Sign Out              (/public/signout)

 * With these options implemented, we need one more feature: an "admin" page
   for the public interface.  This is where an administrator can edit the
   "public" app's data structures.

 * Two commands: Edit Public Users, and Edit Public Accounts.
